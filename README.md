# MSU Thesis Class Version 4.0 2022/12/13

Copyright 2011-2022 by Alan Munn <amunn@msu.edu>

This is a class file for producing dissertations and theses according to
the Michigan State University Graduate School Guidelines for Electronic
Submission of Master's Theses and Dissertations (September 2022).

The class is based on the `memoir` document class, and therefore inherits
all of the functionality of that class.


# Update on new formatting requirements (Fall 2022)

It seems that the Graduate School has again changed some of the formatting requirements as of September 2022. I have just become aware of them and will try to update the class as soon as I can. It's still helpful to email me the complaints that you get from the thesis office, but as of now (October, 2022) I am aware of the issue.
