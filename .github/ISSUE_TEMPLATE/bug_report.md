## Before you report a problem
 -  Please make sure you have the latest version of the class (check the log file).
 -  Please make sure you've checked all the issues listed in CONTRIBUTING.


## Describe the problem

A clear and concise description of what the problem is.

## Reproduce the problem

Please include an error-free, compilable sample document for me to test. The best option is for this to be a small sample document using the class that you create that recreates the problem you're having. (Of course if the class actually causes the error, your sample doesn't need to be error free; but it should be free of errors unrelated to the class itself.)

```latex
\documentclass{msu-thesis}
\begin{document}

\end{document}
```
## A PDF or screenshot of the unexpected output
Add a screenshot of the unexpected output

## Do not post your entire thesis here!

 -  If you feel the need to send me your thesis, please send a zip of all the files, otherwise it becomes impossible to test otherwise.

 -  If you are using Overleaf, PLEASE check the log file for errors, and fix them **before** you send me a sample document. Overleaf has a tendency to produce output even when the document has lots of errors, and it is extremely time consuming for me to fix errors that have nothing to do with the class before trying to help you with your actual problem.
